# Unsupervised Learning
Data have no lable, only X set, no y. Find some structure from the data.  
Application:  
  * Market segmentation
  * Social network analysis
  * Organize computer clusters
  * Astronomical data analysis
## Clustering

### K-means
* Steps:
  1. Initialize k cluster centroids
  2. Assign points to the cluster centroids
  3. Move the cluster centroids according the grouped points
  4. repeat 2-3 until the cluster centroids stop moving
  5. get different k groups.
